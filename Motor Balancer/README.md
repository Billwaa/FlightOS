The Motor Balancer is constructed to test the behavior of a PID controller verus a Cascade PID Controller. The PID Controller compare only target and sensor angle and generate a motor ouput signal. On the other hand, Cascade PID Controller use the first controller to calculate a target rotation rate, then a second controller is used to calculate motor output from the target and sensor rotation rate. More can be found in the thesis.
