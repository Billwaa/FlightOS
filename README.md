# FlightOS
This repository hold the source codes to the Lehigh University Space Hopper Simulator project. The Flight Operating System (FlightOS) is consisted of several individual software modules to provide the guidance, navigation and control for multirotor flying platforms. The project went through several iterations and the software is available in Python for a BeagleBone Black flight computer and the most recent version is written in C++ for the Arduino DUE. Documentations can be found in the thesis.

Source Files Will Be Uploaded Soon After I Finish The Thesis!
